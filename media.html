  <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
  <p>My name is Eunice Olaitan Oladele, and my journey into technology began with a deep curiosity about how things work and a desire to solve real problems. As a Software Engineering student at Trent University, I’ve grown increasingly passionate about creating systems that are not just functional, but inclusive, ethical, and user-centered.
    Coming from a background where access to resources wasn’t always guaranteed, I’ve seen firsthand the power of technology to bridge gaps — and I want to be part of that change. My experiences, from supporting international students to organizing workshops that empower workers, have reinforced my commitment to building tools that serve people meaningfully.
    In my academic work, I’ve focused on software design, object-oriented programming, and cloud systems — with a growing interest in the intersection of AI, accessibility, and human impact. I see technology not just as a career path, but as a platform to advocate, innovate, and drive progress.
